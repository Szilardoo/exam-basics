# EXAM: Programming Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up


# Tasks
## 1-3. Complete the following tasks: (~90 mins)
- [Odd Average](oddavg/odd_avg.py)

#### Your answer:
[add your answer here]   
1:   Signature
2:   Function name
3:   Parameter variable
4:   Function body
5:   Local variable
6:   Return statement
7:   Return value

### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:
[The constructor is always written as a function called __init__().It must always take as its first argument a reference to the instance being constructed. This is typically called self. It has to be called immediately after an instance of the class is created. Every parameter here is the class own parameters. For example:

class Example():

    def __init__(self, parameter_a):
        self.variable_a = parameter_a
        self.variable_b = 5
]
